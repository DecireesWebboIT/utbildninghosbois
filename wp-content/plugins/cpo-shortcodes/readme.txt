== Frequently Asked Questions ==

[Read The Documentation At CPOThemes](http://www.cpothemes.com/documentation/)

= HELP! My shortcodes are not working! =
Go to Settings > CPO Shortcodes and see what the **Shortcode Prefix** is. This prefix is meant to avoid conflicts with other plugins (in case you have a plugin that also has a --button-- shortcode). Simply make sure the shortcodes you are using correspond to the prefix in there. For example, if your prefix is **ct**, then you should use the **ct_button** shortcode. If you have an empty prefix, you can use just **button**.
